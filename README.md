# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This was a project created during the Technigo Bootcamp. 
The main goals with this project were to:
- learn how to use React Native to create a mobile app.
- practice using Styled Components for styling.

## The problem
During this week I experienced a lot of technical difficulties with my computer, resulting in the fact that I only had 2 days to work on this project. 

If I had more time I really would have wanted to work on the shake sensor branch. I also would have chosen a more interesting API with more usable data to make the App show more than just random facts.

I experienced some problems with the API for dog facts. From time to time the fetch does not work, and other times it works as normal without the code being modified. I have not yet had time to troubleshoot this properly.
